        <p>
          I'm Scott Pickering, a passionate React Software Engineer from
          Stevenage. I embarked on my coding journey in 2021, driven by an
          insatiable curiosity and a desire to create innovative solutions. With
          a foundation in learning built on JavaScript, I am passionate about
          bringing positive change to the world through code!
        </p>
        <p>
          I thoroughly enjoy the challenge of deconstructing complex problems
          into manageable tasks and deploying them into my work. My dedication
          to mastering the intricacies of JavaScript has led me to explore its
          nuances, from front-end frameworks like React to server-side
          environments like Node.js & Express.js and Database technologies such
          as MongoDB, my learning has presented to me a dedicated character
          trait that I wish to cultivate further. If I am learning something new
          every day, I consider that day a great success.
